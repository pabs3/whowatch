- Y-expand pad if data source has more lines than currently available
- output only visible lines in a pad and prefetch if necessary?
- cache for cursor_line -> pid/uid mapping?
- call clear_list() in process.c?
- if exti not full filled with some data then it blinks
  if scrolling underlaying window (ulist/plist)
- after resize call scr_crsr_resize to move crsr if necessary
- clear line in ulist coz after cmd changes for something shorter you can see
   old string
- ulist: after login, info shows new number of users with a delay
- ulist: if last line deleted end cursor there, then cursor is refreshed after some time
- KBD_RIGHT: count how far text inside exti can be moved
- KBD_ESC: add it to wdts
- input box resize - decor box problem and cursor moving outside
- don't refresh anything in key_action() if any key (without handler) was pressed.

FUNCTIONALITY:
- freeze process tree and mark multiple processes to kill
- display nr of processes, zombies, working etc.
- make search box small, maybe at the last line

FreeBSD port:
- command-lines: kvm needs root, fall back on /proc or libprocstat
- users
- files
- inodes
- modules
- file descriptors
